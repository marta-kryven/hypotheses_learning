For each box there is a key that opens it, so the goal of the game is to use the right key for each box. 
You have a demonstration video from a teacher telling you how to open all boxes. In the video, the teacher says:
"I’m going to show you the right way to unlock the doors. To open the doors, you have to use a key that matches the color of the box. So, to open this red box, I’m going to use this red key. Great, now you can open all the doors!”

Here are the boxes:
The red  box has 1 moon shape. 
The pink box has 2 cloud shapes. Each cloud is numbered from 1 to 2.
The cream (a color between yellow and white) box has 4 daimond shapes. Each daimond is numbered from 1 to 4.
The purple box has 3 heart shapes. Each heart is numbered from 1 to 3.
The teal (a color between green and blue) box has 5 triangle shapes. Each triangle is numbered from 1 to 5.


And here are the keys (in no specific order):
The red1  key is red and has the number 1.
The pink6 key is pink and has the number 6.
The grey2 key is grey and has the number 2.
The greycloud key is grey and has a cloud shape.
The orange4 key is orange and has the number 4.
The green3 key is green  and has the number 3.
The bluestar key is blue  and has a star shape.
The yellow5 key is yellow and has the number 5.
The greenheart key is green and has a  heart shape.
The white7 key is white and has the number 7.
The triangleyellow key is yellow and has a triangle shape.
The diamondorange key is orange  and has a diamond shape.
The purplearrow key is purple and has an arrow shape.
